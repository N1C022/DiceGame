# DiceGame
This is a simple two player game
Each player rolls 2-6 dice, if they get a double their score resets to the last checkpoint (every 50 points)
otherwise the sum of the dice is added to their score
first to 500 wins
also some extra stuff like: GODs that can bless or punish you, RANDOM PRIZES which you have a chance of earning every round, GAMBLE MODE if you are losing by 200 or more points that can help you catch up
